    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

    <p>
      By using Free Perl Code, you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, please don't use the site.
      We've kept these terms simple and understandable—no pages of legal jargon.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Content is Provided "As-Is"</h2>

    <p>
      All content on Free Perl Code—including code examples, explanations, and AI-generated responses—is
      provided for informational and learning purposes. We strive for accuracy but cannot guarantee
      that all content is error-free or suitable for your specific situation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Code examples may require adaptation for your environment. Always test code in a safe,
      isolated environment before using it in production.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Code Execution</h2>

    <h3>Browser-Based Execution</h3>

    <p>
      Some pages include a "Run" button that executes Perl code in your browser using WebPerl
      (WebAssembly). This execution happens locally on your device. We are not responsible for:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Any damage to your system from running code</li>
      <li>Resource consumption (CPU, memory) during execution</li>
      <li>Results or outcomes of executed code</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sandbox Execution</h3>

    <p>
      For server-side code execution (if available), code runs in a restricted sandbox with
      limits on time, memory, and network access. Do not rely on this sandbox for:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Processing sensitive or confidential data</li>
      <li>Tasks requiring specific security guarantees</li>
      <li>Production workloads</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>

    <p>
      You agree not to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Attempt to bypass the sandbox or exploit security limitations</li>
      <li>Use the service to distribute malware or harmful code</li>
      <li>Scrape the site at high volume without permission</li>
      <li>Abuse the AI chat feature (e.g., automated requests, spam)</li>
      <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer the AI or bypass rate limits</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. AI Chat Feature</h2>

    <p>
      The AI chat assistant provides responses based on Free Perl Code content and general Perl knowledge.
      AI responses may not always be accurate. You should:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Verify important information through official documentation</li>
      <li>Test code examples before using in production</li>
      <li>Use AI responses as a starting point, not definitive answers</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Rate limits apply to prevent abuse. These limits are subject to change.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>

    <h3>Your Rights</h3>

    <p>
      You retain ownership of any content you submit. By submitting content to Free Perl Code (e.g.,
      through feedback forms or feature requests), you grant us a license to use that content
      for improving the service.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Content</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Republish large portions of our content without permission</li>
      <li>Use our content to train competing AI models</li>

    <h2>8. Changes to These Terms</h2>

      faith negotiation whenever possible.
