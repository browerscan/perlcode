    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      At Free Perl Code, we believe you shouldn't have to trade your privacy for useful answers.
      This privacy policy explains how we handle data with transparency and respect for your
      privacy.
    </p>

    <h2>Last Updated</h2>

    <p>December 2025</p>

    <h2>Our Privacy-First Approach</h2>

    <p>
      Free Perl Code is designed to be useful without requiring an account or sacrificing your privacy.
      We collect only the minimum data necessary to improve the service and prevent abuse.
      We don't sell your data, and we don't use third-party tracking networks.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Anonymous Analytics</h3>

    <p>
      We may collect lightweight, privacy-preserving analytics to understand how the site is used:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Page URLs visited (to understand which Perl topics are most in demand)</li>
      <li>Referrer (to know how users found us)</li>
      <li>User agent (browser and OS information)</li>
      <li>Country/region (based on IP, for content localization decisions)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These analytics are collected without personally identifying information. We cannot link
      this data to individual users.
    </p>

    <h3>Chat Session Data</h3>

    <p>
      Our AI chat feature uses rate limiting to prevent abuse. To implement this fairly:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>A random session identifier is stored in your browser (localStorage)</li>
      <li>Your IP address is hashed (one-way transformation) for rate limit counting</li>
      <li>Chat messages are temporarily processed to generate responses but not permanently stored</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Code Execution Telemetry</h3>

    <p>
      When you use the "Run" button to execute Perl code in your browser:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Code runs in your browser using WebPerl (WebAssembly)</li>
      <li>Execution happens locally—code is NOT sent to our servers</li>
      <li>No execution results are collected or stored</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What We Don't Do</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>No account requirement:</strong> Use the site without signing up</li>
      <li><strong>No personal data collection:</strong> We don't ask for your name, email, or location</li>
      <li><strong>No tracking pixels:</strong> We don't use invisible trackers from third parties</li>
      <li><strong>No ad networks:</strong> We don't sell ad space or use third-party advertising services</li>
      <li><strong>No data selling:</strong> Your data will never be sold to third parties</li>
      <li><strong>No cross-site tracking:</strong> We don't track you across other websites</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>

    <p>
      We use minimal cookies and local storage:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Essential cookies:</strong> Theme preference (dark/light mode)</li>
      <li><strong>Functional storage:</strong> Chat session state for rate limiting</li>
      <li><strong>Optional cookies:</strong> Analytics (only with your consent via the cookie banner)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You can reject non-essential cookies through the cookie banner or your browser settings.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

    <h3>Content Delivery Network (CDN)</h3>

    <p>
      Free Perl Code may use a CDN to deliver content faster. Your IP address is temporarily processed
      by the CDN to route traffic efficiently, but not logged or stored by us.
    </p>

    <h3>AI Services</h3>

    <p>
      Chat messages are sent to our AI provider (VectorEngine API) to generate responses. These
      messages are not used to train AI models and are not permanently stored.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>

    <p>
      We implement reasonable security measures to protect the limited data we collect:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>HTTPS encryption for all data in transit</li>
      <li>No storage of personal identifying information</li>
      <li>Hashed IP addresses (one-way encryption)</li>
      <li>Regular security reviews of our infrastructure</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>

    <p>
      Because we don't collect personal data, there's little data to manage. However, you have
      the right to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Opt out of analytics:</strong> Use the cookie banner or your browser's privacy controls</li>
      <li><strong>Clear local storage:</strong> Clear your browser data to reset chat limits and preferences</li>
      <li><strong>Access information:</strong> Contact us if you have questions about data practices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>
      Free Perl Code is not directed to children under 13. We don't knowingly collect personal
      information from children. If you believe we've inadvertently collected data from a child,
      please contact us.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

    <p>
      We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Significant changes will be
      prominently displayed on the site. We encourage periodic review of this policy.
    </p>
