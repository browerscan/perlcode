    <h1>About Free Perl Code</h1>

    <p>
      Free Perl Code is a modern, AI-native knowledge base designed specifically for Perl developers.
      Born from the realization that traditional documentation often fails to address real-world
      questions, Free Perl Code combines artificial intelligence with rigorous code verification to
      deliver answers you can trust.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>

    <p>
      Perl remains one of the most powerful programming languages for text processing, system
      administration, and legacy code maintenance. Yet, finding reliable answers to Perl questions
      online can be frustrating. Outdated forum posts, incomplete documentation, and unverified
      code examples waste developer time and introduce bugs into production systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Free Perl Code exists to solve this problem. We're building the most comprehensive, reliable,
      and accessible Perl knowledge base—one that combines the breadth of community-generated
      content with the reliability of verified code execution.
    </p>

    <h2>What Makes Free Perl Code Different</h2>

    <h3>Verified Code Examples</h3>

    <p>
      Every code snippet on Free Perl Code is executed in a Docker sandbox during content generation.
      We capture the actual output (STDOUT), errors (STDERR), execution time, and Perl version.
      This "proof of work" approach means you can trust that the examples work as shown.
    </p>

    <h3>AI-Powered Content Generation</h3>

    <p>
      Our system analyzes real Perl questions from developers worldwide and generates comprehensive
      answers. Each answer is reviewed, verified, and only published after passing quality checks.
      This scalable approach allows us to maintain thousands of high-quality pages.
    </p>

    <h3>Semantic Search with RAG</h3>

    <p>
      Free Perl Code uses vector embeddings to index all content, enabling intelligent search that
      understands the context of your question. When you search for "how to parse JSON," our
      system understands the concept and returns relevant answers even if they don't contain
      the exact phrase.
    </p>

    <h3>AI Chat Assistant</h3>

    <p>
      Our AI chat assistant is trained on the entire Free Perl Code knowledge base. Ask questions in
      natural language and receive answers grounded in verified content. The AI cites specific
      pages for further reading, making it easy to dive deeper into any topic.
    </p>

    <h2>Who Is Free Perl Code For?</h2>

    <h3>Legacy Code Maintainers</h3>

    <p>
      Millions of lines of Perl code power enterprise systems worldwide. If you're responsible
      for maintaining, debugging, or modernizing legacy Perl applications, Free Perl Code provides
      quick answers to the specific challenges you face.
    </p>

    <h3>DevOps Engineers</h3>

    <p>
      Perl has long been a staple in system administration and automation. Free Perl Code helps DevOps
      professionals find efficient solutions for text processing, log analysis, file manipulation,
      and infrastructure automation.
    </p>

    <h3>Bioinformatics Researchers</h3>

    <p>
      Perl remains widely used in bioinformatics for sequence analysis, data parsing, and pipeline
      automation. Free Perl Code covers many domain-specific patterns and techniques used in
      computational biology.
    </p>

    <h3>Perl Learners</h3>

    <p>
      Whether you're new to programming or coming from another language, Free Perl Code's verified
      examples and clear explanations help you learn Perl concepts correctly from the start.
    </p>

    <h2>Technology Stack</h2>

    <p>
      Free Perl Code is built with modern web technologies to deliver a fast, responsive experience:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Astro static site generator with Preact components and Tailwind CSS</li>
      <li><strong>API:</strong> Bun runtime with Hono framework for low-latency responses</li>
      <li><strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for semantic search</li>
      <li><strong>AI:</strong> VectorEngine API for embeddings and chat completions</li>
      <li><strong>Search:</strong> Pagefind for instant client-side search</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The State of Perl in 2025</h2>

    <p>
      Contrary to rumors of Perl's decline, the language is experiencing a remarkable resurgence.
      In September 2025, Perl jumped from 27th to 10th place in the TIOBE Index—one of the most
      dramatic gains in the index's history. This comeback reflects the enduring value of Perl
      in specific domains where newer languages haven't been able to compete.
    </p>

    <p>
      Organizations in finance, telecommunications, bioinformatics, and enterprise infrastructure
      continue to rely on Perl for mission-critical systems. With over 37 years of development
      and more than 200,000 modules on CPAN, Perl offers a battle-tested ecosystem that newer
      languages simply cannot match.
