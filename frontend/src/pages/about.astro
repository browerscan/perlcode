    <h1>About PerlCode</h1>
    <p>
      PerlCode is a static-first Perl knowledge base focused on one thing: answers you can
      trust. Many pages include code that was executed in a sandbox, with captured output
      shown on the page (proof-of-work).
    </p>
    <h2>What makes it different</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Runnability-first examples (designed to run with <code>perl -</code>).</li>
      <li>Gradual publishing to keep quality high and SEO safe.</li>
      <li>Search + chat to help you navigate legacy code quickly.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
